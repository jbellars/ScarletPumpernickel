This is based circuitously on Jon Lam's Vibrant Ink theme (which was a copy of the TextMate/Rails theme), which Rob Conery turned into his own VibrantInk theme, after which he made a second version (VibrantInk_V2). I used that theme (VibrantInk_V2) for a while, but started tweaking some of the annoyances with the colors and the contrast (including subduing the vibrance). The result is a bit like subdued cartoon colors. "The Scarlet Pumpernickel" is simply the most memorable cartoon name that comes to mind at the moment. A version of this was uploaded to http://studiostyl.es/schemes/the-scarlet-pumpernickel, however that site only permitted the .vssettings file to be 92 lines, whereas the actual settings file consists of 2735 lines. This is the full version.
